#### Description:
Space Explorer Toolkit is a command-line Python application that lets users explore planetary physics and facts in an interactive, educational way. Designed for students, space enthusiasts, and educators, the toolkit includes the following features:

- 🌍 BMI Calculator: Computes BMI using Earth-based weight and height.
- 🪐 Weight on Planets: Calculates effective weight on other planets using gravity ratios.
- 🚀 Escape Velocity: Computes escape velocity using the formula √(2GM/R).
- 📊 Planetary Facts: Displays day length and year duration for selected planets.

This project demonstrates programming concepts like gravitational physics, unit conversion, error handling, and more, while introducing users to scientific applications through Python.

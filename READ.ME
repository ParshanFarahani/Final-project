# 🌌 Space Explorer Toolkit

## 👨‍🚀 Project Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly space exploration tool designed to help users learn basic planetary physics and facts. It allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI), determine their weight on other planets, compute escape velocities, and explore planetary day/year durations.

## 🧠 Features
- Calculate BMI on Earth
- Compute your weight on other planets based on gravity ratios
- Calculate escape velocity using the formula √(2GM/R)
- Display planetary facts: day length and year duration

## 🪐 Supported Planets
- Mercury
- Earth
- Jupiter
*(You can expand the dataset by adding more planets to the `PLANETS` dictionary.)*

## 🛠 How to Run
Run the program from the command line:

```bash
python project.py

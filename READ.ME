# 🚀 Space Explorer Toolkit 🌌

## Project Overview

Space Explorer Toolkit is a command-line application written in Python that allows users to explore basic planetary physics and facts in a fun, interactive, and educational way. Designed for students, space enthusiasts, and curious minds, this toolkit provides a set of tools that simulate how human measurements and physics behave across different planets in our solar system. It combines scientific accuracy with beginner-friendly programming practices to create a learning experience that is both engaging and informative.

The project includes four core features: calculating Body Mass Index (BMI), determining weight on other planets based on gravity ratios, computing escape velocities using real-world physics formulas, and displaying planetary facts such as day length and year duration. These features are powered by a structured dataset containing mass, radius, gravity, and orbital data for selected planets including Mercury, Earth, and Jupiter. The dataset is designed to be easily expandable, allowing users to add more planets or celestial bodies in the future.

## Educational Purpose

This project demonstrates how programming can be used to model real-world scientific concepts. It introduces users to gravitational physics, unit conversion, and planetary science, while reinforcing core programming skills such as:

- Function design and modularity
- Error handling and input validation
- Dictionary-based data structures
- Mathematical computation using constants and formulas
- User interaction via command-line interfaces

By interacting with the toolkit, users gain insight into how gravity affects weight, how escape velocity is calculated, and how planetary time differs from Earth’s. The project encourages curiosity and exploration, and can be expanded to include more planets, moons, or even fictional worlds. It also serves as a great example of how simple programming tools can be used to build educational simulations that connect science and technology.

## Features

- 🌍 **BMI Calculator** – Computes BMI using Earth-based weight and height. This feature helps users understand how BMI is calculated and why it matters.
- 🪐 **Weight on Planets** – Calculates effective weight on other planets using gravity ratios. Users can compare how their weight would change depending on the planet’s gravitational pull.
- 🚀 **Escape Velocity** – Computes escape velocity using the formula √(2GM/R). This feature introduces users to a key concept in astrophysics and space travel.
- 📊 **Planetary Facts** – Displays day length and year duration for selected planets. Users can learn how time works differently across the solar system.

# 🚀 Space Explorer Toolkit 🌌

## 📘 Overview

**Space Explorer Toolkit** is a command-line Python application that lets users explore planetary physics and facts in an interactive, educational way. Designed for students, space enthusiasts, and curious minds, this toolkit simulates how human measurements and physics behave across different planets in our solar system.

Users can calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI), determine their weight on other planets, compute escape velocities, and learn planetary facts such as day length and year duration. The project is built with scientific accuracy and beginner-friendly programming practices.
